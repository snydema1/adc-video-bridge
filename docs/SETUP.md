# Setup Guide

End-to-end walkthrough for deploying adc-video-bridge on a server and connecting it to Homebridge for live streaming and motion notifications in Apple HomeKit.

## Prerequisites

- A server or machine that can run Docker (Linux, macOS, etc.)
- An Alarm.com account with cameras that support end-to-end WebRTC streaming (e.g. ADC-V723)
- [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) with the [homebridge-camera-ffmpeg](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg) plugin installed

## Step 1: Discover your cameras

Clone the repo and run the discovery tool to find your camera IDs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omar-L/adc-video-bridge.git
cd adc-video-bridge
npm install

# Set credentials temporarily for discovery
export ADC_USERNAME="your@email.com"
export ADC_PASSWORD="yourpassword"

npx tsx src/discover.ts
```

This prints a table of cameras on your account and outputs ready-to-paste YAML for the config files. Note the camera IDs and names.

## Step 2: Configure the bridge

Copy the example configs:

```bash
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
cp config/go2rtc.example.yaml config/go2rtc.yaml
```

### `config/config.yaml`

Your ADC credentials, cameras, and optional Homebridge motion integration:

```yaml
alarm:
  username: "your@email.com"
  password: "yourpassword"
  mfaToken: ""  # optional, for 2FA bypass

cameras:
  - id: "100652375-2048"
    name: "driveway"              # go2rtc stream name (lowercase, no spaces)
    homebridgeName: "Driveway"    # must match the camera name in homebridge-camera-ffmpeg
    quality: "hd"
  - id: "100652375-2050"
    name: "backyard"
    homebridgeName: "Backyard"
    quality: "hd"

go2rtc:
  apiUrl: "http://localhost:1984"
  rtspPort: 8554

# Optional: forward motion and/or physical doorbell-press events to homebridge-camera-ffmpeg
homebridge:
  motionUrl: "http://<homebridge-ip>:8080"
  doorbellUrl: "http://<homebridge-ip>:8080"
  motionTimeoutMs: 60000  # reset motion after 60s of no activity

logging:
  level: "info"
```

- `name` is the go2rtc stream identifier — keep it lowercase with no spaces.
- `homebridgeName` must exactly match the camera name you set in homebridge-camera-ffmpeg.
- `homebridge.motionUrl` forwards motion events and `homebridge.doorbellUrl` forwards physical doorbell presses. They are independent; omit either one to disable that event type.
- Both URLs are the base URL of the homebridge-camera-ffmpeg HTTP server. Leave the entire `homebridge` section out to disable all Homebridge webhooks.

### `config/go2rtc.yaml`

Each camera needs a matching empty stream entry. The stream names must match the `name` field in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
streams:
  driveway: ""
  backyard: ""

rtsp:
  listen: ":8554"

api:
  listen: ":1984"

log:
  level: info
```

## Step 3: Deploy with Docker

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

Verify the streams are running:

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Open go2rtc web UI to see active streams
# http://<server-ip>:1984

# Test a stream in VLC
# rtsp://<server-ip>:8554/driveway
```

All three cameras should show `"streaming"` in the periodic status log.

## Step 4: Configure homebridge-camera-ffmpeg

In the Homebridge UI, add a camera to the Camera-ffmpeg platform for each stream. Replace `<server-ip>` with the IP of the machine running adc-video-bridge.

### Per-camera settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Name** | `Driveway` (must match `homebridgeName` in config.yaml) |
| **Video Source** | `-i rtsp://<server-ip>:8554/driveway` |
| **Still Image Source** | `-timeout 10000000 -i http://<server-ip>:1984/api/frame.jpeg?src=driveway -vframes 1` |
| **Audio** | disabled |
| **Motion sensor** | enabled |
| **Motion Timeout** | `0` (the bridge controls the reset via `motionTimeoutMs`) |

For a doorbell camera, also enable **Doorbell**. Keep **Motion Doorbell** disabled unless you intentionally want motion events treated as button presses.

The `-timeout 10000000` (10 seconds) on the still image source prevents ffmpeg from hanging indefinitely when go2rtc has no frame available during token refresh gaps. Without it, Homebridge can become unresponsive.

### Platform-level settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **HTTP Port** | `8080` (must match `motionUrl` port in config.yaml) |

Restart Homebridge after making changes.

## Step 5: Enable motion notifications in HomeKit

For each camera in the Apple Home app:

1. Long press the camera tile
2. Tap the gear icon (settings)
3. Enable **Notifications** for motion events

Motion is detected via Alarm.com's real-time WebSocket event stream and forwarded to Homebridge automatically. When a camera detects motion, the bridge sends a trigger to homebridge-camera-ffmpeg's HTTP server, which activates the HomeKit motion sensor. After the configured timeout (default 60 seconds), the motion sensor resets.

Physical doorbell presses are forwarded separately to the plugin's doorbell endpoint. Motion events never call that endpoint, so ordinary motion does not produce a doorbell notification.

## Rebuild and redeploy

After pulling new changes or modifying config:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

Config file changes (in `config/`) don't require a rebuild — just restart:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml restart
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Streams not starting**: Check logs for authentication errors. Verify credentials in `config.yaml`.
- **Snapshots timing out in Homebridge**: Ensure the still image source includes `-timeout 10000000` before `-i`.
- **Motion not triggering in HomeKit**: Verify `homebridgeName` matches the camera name in homebridge-camera-ffmpeg exactly (case-sensitive). Check that the motion sensor is enabled in the plugin config and notifications are enabled in the Home app.
- **"Camera not found" in motion webhook logs**: The `homebridgeName` doesn't match. The bridge calls `GET http://<motionUrl>/motion?<homebridgeName>` — the name must be an exact match.
- **Doorbell press not triggering in HomeKit**: Verify `doorbellUrl`, the HTTP port, and the exact `homebridgeName`. The bridge calls `GET http://<doorbellUrl>/doorbell?<homebridgeName>` only for Alarm.com doorbell-press events.
- **go2rtc web UI not loading**: Ensure port 1984 is exposed in docker-compose.yml and not blocked by a firewall.

## Local development

For developing without Docker:

```bash
npm install
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your credentials

# Requires go2rtc running separately
npm run dev
```
